For example, write out pseudo-code (both casual and formal) that does the following:

a method that returns the sum of two integers
# Collect two integers
# Add both intefers 

# START
# SET a variable as an integer
# SET a variable as the 2nd integer
# READ both variables and add the variables
# END

a method that takes an array of strings, and 
returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together
# Collect an array of strings and input it into the method as arguemnts
# Iterate through the array of strings
# Save each string into a new variable
# Add all the variables that contain strings and create a new variable which adds all strings together.

# START
# SET array of strings
# Place array into method
# Iterate array
# SET Iteration value to variable
# READ all variables and add together into a new variable


a method that takes an array of integers, and 
returns a new array with every other element


# Collect an array of integers and place into a method
# Iterate through the array
# Return the number if it is odd
# Save the number into a new array

# SET array of integers
# Place into method
# Iterate through array
# IF iteration value is odd push into new array
# READ new array
# END
